# Robot Club

Coding club was an occassional lunchtime session organised within the School of Psychology, where someone would give an informal coding-related talk/workshop relevant to psychologists.  Robot Club<a name="note1"><sup>1</sup></a> emerged in 2017 as an offshoot of Coding Club.  The idea was to create a more _hands-on_, informal environment, where people could bring coding problems to a place where they were likely to find solutions.  People with problems would develop their skills by working with someone who could scaffold their learning.  Problem solvers would develop their skills by putting themselves on the spot by trying to solve real psychology programming problems, in real time.  Shoulder surfers would learn by osmosis.  Programming in pairs and groups is common practice in industrial software development, as it seems to enhance productivity.  I think this is called a community of practise.

## A Community of Practise in Practice

We did valuable work.  However, it was hard to organise a regular session at a time that people could attend, so it tended to be a hardcore who came to these sessions, and there was more expertise than problems.  I think the main reason this wasn't effective is that, apart from larger programming issues, you can't really wait for the next Robot Club to come around to find help.  If you don't give up, you probably do what everyone else does i.e. use what expertise you have, Stack Overflow, Google, and some impression of the scientific method ("debugging"), to solve the problem yourself.  This tends to be slow, frustrating and unenjoyable.

As I see it, this is a scheduling problem.  Say you're stuck with some R programming.  There is a range of (often hidden) expertise (from [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) to professor) nearby with the potential to help you.  However, a person's level of expertise is probably negatively correlated with their immediate availability to help.  Everyone's busy, so it's not really fair to interrupt people whenever you're stuck.  On the other had, my experience is that people are more than happy to share their knowledge _when it's convenient_. 

# Robot Hour

Robot Hour is a proposed improvement to the Robot Club experiment.  Faculty balance a similar supply and demand of wisdom by having office hours.  So the idea is that anyone within the School can publish hours when they are available to help with programming problems.  Wisdom providers ("wizards") would publish their availability, location, and expertise on an online calendar.  Wisdom "seekers" could scan this calendar and choose a wizard based on 
any of these variables.  Ideally, the outputs of these sessions would be shared for the benefit of the community.  This is [easy with GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/earcanal/b466630c2db64b60365f6049c15f5117). 

<sup>[1](#note1)</sup> The first rule of Robot Club is, "You do not ask why it's called Robot Club.".  The second rule of Robot Club is, "*You do not ask why it's called Robot Club.*"  No wait ... I got that wrong.  The second rule of Robot Club is, "No smoking.".
