# The Experiment Factory: An overview

## Abstract

[The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/) is an open software framework which aims to address the technological barriers to replication in psychology and behavioural science.  This talk will demonstrate how the framework can be used to rapidly create and deploy a study in the lab and online.  

  1. Avoid programming altogether by creating a study from [freely available experimental tasks, surveys and games](https://expfactory.github.io/experiments/)
  1. Use jsPsych to develop your own experiments and surveys that run in a browser. (This is relatively easy if you have experience with ePrime, PsychoPy, OpenSesame etc.)
  1. Deploy your study locally or online using Docker, with data written to files or a database

## Re-using experiments, surveys (and games)

* jsPsych experiments can be run statically e.g. [Stroop](https://expfactory-experiments.github.io/stroop)
* Surveys are simply TSVs e.g. [State Mindfulness Survey](https://github.com/expfactory-experiments/state-mindfulness-survey)
