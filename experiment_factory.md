# The Experiment Factory: An overview

## Abstract

[The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/) is a software framework for rapid creation and replication of behavioural experiments, both in the lab and online.  This talk will give a high level overview of running a study using The Experiment factory, including: 

    1. Avoiding programming altogether by using the [library of freely available behavioural experiments, surveys and games](https://expfactory.github.io/experiments/).
    1. Developing an experiment that runs in a browser using jsPsych (relatively easy if you've done the same with ePrime, PsychoPy, OpenSesame etc.)
    1. Deploying your study and collecting data locally or online using Docker
