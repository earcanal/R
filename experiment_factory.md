# The Experiment Factory: An overview

## Abstract

[The Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory/) is an open software framework for rapid creation and replication of behavioural experiments, both in the lab and online.  This talk will give a high level overview of The Experiment factory: 

  1. Avoid programming altogether by creating a study from [freely available experimental tasks, surveys and games](https://expfactory.github.io/experiments/)
  1. Use jsPsych to your own experiment that runs in a browser (relatively easy if you have experience with ePrime, PsychoPy, OpenSesame etc.)
  1. Deploy your study locally or online using Docker, with data written to files or a database
