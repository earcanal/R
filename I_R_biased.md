# My biased view of R within an open science tool-chain

## Tools

* git
  * For all of the reasons SÃ©verin gave in his overview
* (R) markdown
  * See upcoming seminar!
  * I wrote this using github's markdown editor!
* Open source/data/educational resources/science
  * "Why is my evil lecturer making me learn SPSS, e-Prime (etc.)?"
  * R (obviously!)
  * but also [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/), [PsyToolkit](http://www.psytoolkit.org/)
  * "plumbing"
    * LaTeX, make
 
## (Meta) Programming approaches

* Learn R
  * Introductions
    * Plymouth University: Introduction to R (excellent intensive bootstrap)
      * Contact Graduate School, [Dr Julian Stander](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/julian-stander) or [Dr Luciana Dalla Valle](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/luciana-dalla-valle)
    * [*Official* Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
  * by example
    * [R Cookbook](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KIHuSXyhawEC)
    * Online [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/)
      * by author of [R Graphics Cookbook](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_iVFgKTRYrQC)
    * [R for Data Science](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034407.do)
    * [Exploratory Data Analysis in R: Case Study](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-r-case-study).  I haven't taken this course, but I recall rating DataCamp when I first looked at R.

* [Pair programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming)
  * scaffolded help _when you need it_
  * Real time
    * requires a pool of developers
    * e.g. [Slack](https://psych-plymouth-ac-uk.slack.com/messages/@stuartgspicer/) -> [Floobits](https://floobits.com/earcanal)
    * or [Hackhands](https://hackhands.com/)
  * Some lag
    * [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
  * we do this instinctively
    * Charlotte, Jon, Laurence, and Stuart [re-factored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) Andy's code
  * [Rubber ducking](http://wiki.c2.com/?RubberDucking) when nobody's available  
* Debugging in R Studio

* META: Crowdcast
    * recording, flipped learning etc.

## Examples

* [Attentional Bias Modification study](https://github.com/earcanal/dotprobe)
  * [make](https://github.com/earcanal/msc_dissertation/blob/master/Makefile)
  * [LaTeX/knitr](https://github.com/earcanal/msc_dissertation/blob/master/dissertation.Rnw)
 
* [Chocolate craving study](https://github.com/earcanal/chocolate_craving)
  * **rprime**: [how](https://github.com/earcanal/chocolate_craving/commits/master) I got from [example code](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rprime/vignettes/multiple-files.html) to [something that processes my data](https://github.com/earcanal/chocolate_craving/blob/master/craving_chocolate.R)
