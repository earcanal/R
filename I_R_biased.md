# My biased view of R within an open science tool-chain

## Resources

* git
* (R) markdown
  * I wrote this using github's markdown editor!
* Open source/data/educational resources/science
  * "Why is my evil lecturer making me learn SPSS, e-Prime (etc.)?"
  * R (obviously!)
  * but also [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/), [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/), [PsyToolkit](http://www.psytoolkit.org/)
* META: Crowdcast
  * recording
* Resources
  * Introduction to R (excellent intensive bootstrap)
    * Contact PU Graduate School [Dr Julian Stander](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/julian-stander) or [Dr Luciana Dalla Valle](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/luciana-dalla-valle)

## (Meta) Programming approaches

* Pair programming
  * scaffolded help _when you need it_
  * Real time
    * requires a pool of developers
    * ideally e.g. Slack -> Floobits
    * or [Hackhands](https://hackhands.com/)
  * Some lag
    * [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

## Examples

* [Attentional Bias Modification study](https://github.com/earcanal/dotprobe)
  * make
  * LaTeX
  * knitr
* [Chocolate craving study](https://github.com/earcanal/chocolate_craving)
  * *rprime*: how I got from the example to something that processes my data
  * Where next?  Who wants to pair?
